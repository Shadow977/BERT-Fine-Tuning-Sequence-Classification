# BERT Fine Tuning Sequence Classification
 ## Introduction
 The code in this notebook is actually a simplified version of the [run_glue.py](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/master/examples/text-classification/run_glue.py)   example script from huggingface.

`run_glue.py` is a helpful utility which allows you to pick which GLUE benchmark task you want to run on, and which pre-trained model you want to use (you can see the list of possible models [here](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/e6cff60b4cbc1158fbd6e4a1c3afda8dc224f566/examples/run_glue.py#L69)). It also supports using either the CPU, a single GPU, or multiple GPUs. It even supports using 16-bit precision if you want further speed up.

Unfortunately, all of this configurability comes at the cost of *readability*. In this Notebook, we've simplified the code greatly and added plenty of comments to make it clear what's going on. 

 ## What is BERT?

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), released in late 2018, is the model we will use in this tutorial to provide readers with a better understanding of and practical guidance for using transfer learning models in NLP. BERT is a method of pretraining language representations that was used to create models that NLP practicioners can then download and use for free. You can either use these models to extract high quality language features from your text data, or you can fine-tune these models on a specific task (classification, entity recognition, question answering, etc.) with your own data to produce state of the art predictions.

This post will explain how you can modify and fine-tune BERT to create a powerful NLP model that quickly gives you state of the art results. 

## Advantages of Fine_tuning.

In this tutorial, we will use BERT to train a text classifier. Specifically, we will take the pre-trained BERT model, add an untrained layer of neurons on the end, and train the new model for our classification task. Why do this rather than train a train a specific deep learning model (a CNN, BiLSTM, etc.) that is well suited for the specific NLP task you need? 

1. **Quicker Development**

    * First, the pre-trained BERT model weights already encode a lot of information about our language. As a result, it takes much less time to train our fine-tuned model - it is as if we have already trained the bottom layers of our network extensively and only need to gently tune them while using their output as features for our classification task. In fact, the authors recommend only 2-4 epochs of training for fine-tuning BERT on a specific NLP task (compared to the hundreds of GPU hours needed to train the original BERT model or a LSTM from scratch!). 

2. **Less Data**

    * In addition and perhaps just as important, because of the pre-trained weights this method allows us to fine-tune our task on a much smaller dataset than would be required in a model that is built from scratch. A major drawback of NLP models built from scratch is that we often need a prohibitively large dataset in order to train our network to reasonable accuracy, meaning a lot of time and energy had to be put into dataset creation. By fine-tuning BERT, we are now able to get away with training a model to good performance on a much smaller amount of training data.

3. **Better Results**

    * Finally, this simple fine-tuning procedure (typically adding one fully-connected layer on top of BERT and training for a few epochs) was shown to achieve state of the art results with minimal task-specific adjustments for a wide variety of tasks: classification, language inference, semantic similarity, question answering, etc. Rather than implementing custom and sometimes-obscure architetures shown to work well on a specific task, simply fine-tuning BERT is shown to be a better (or at least equal) alternative.


## Hugging Face Transformers Library.
the [transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) is a package from Hugging Face which will give us a pytorch interface for working with BERT. (This library contains interfaces for other pretrained language models like OpenAI's GPT and GPT-2.) We've selected the pytorch interface because it strikes a nice balance between the high-level APIs (which are easy to use but don't provide insight into how things work) and tensorflow code (which contains lots of details but often sidetracks us into lessons about tensorflow, when the purpose here is BERT!).

At the moment, the Hugging Face library seems to be the most widely accepted and powerful pytorch interface for working with BERT. In addition to supporting a variety of different pre-trained transformer models, the library also includes pre-built modifications of these models suited to your specific task. For example, in this tutorial we will use `BertForSequenceClassification`.

The library also includes task-specific classes for token classification, question answering, next sentence prediciton, etc. Using these pre-built classes simplifies the process of modifying BERT for your purposes.
